This directory contains tools to create the geolocation tables in the 
database, which map from committees, candidates, and individuals to 
their longitude and latitude.   These tables are created after
the FEC tables are created and populated.

To create the tables:

sqlplus cs339/passwd @setup.sql

To populate the tables:

./geolocate.pl

This can take a long time.  About a day on our hardware in Fall 2012.

You can drop the tables via

sqlplus cs339/passwd @drop.sql
